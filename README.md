# busy_bee
Atari ST emulator in Rust

Ive not refactored yet as I want this to remain clear on the process rather than dive in and hide everything with macros.  Althpugh macros can really help with duplicated content they can also be quite an obfuscated for anyone new to the language or domain.  

Eventually I aim to have this running with Wasm with a JavaScrip front end possibly using TypeScript or Fable or ReasonML,  maybe all of those to see what feels the best.
