This is an Atari ST emulator in Rust

Ive not refactored yet as I want this to remain clear on the process rather than dive in and hide everything with macros.  Although macros can really help with duplicated content they can also be an obfuscator for anyone new to the language or domain.  Saying this there asre a few macros in here to help with numeric conversions.

Eventually I aim to have this running with Wasm with a JavaScrip front end possibly using TypeScript or Fable or ReasonML,  maybe all of those to see what feels the best.
